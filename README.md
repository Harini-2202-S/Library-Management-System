VLIT â€“ VIT Library & Information Tracker

A smart digital library system built using Flask, MySQL, and CSV book data to simplify and modernize the experience of searching, saving, and reviewing books in a university setting. Designed for quick access, seamless interactions, and student-centered design.



Project Overview

VLIB (VIT Library & Information Tracker) was developed as part of LIBATHON 2025, a 24-hour hackathon event aimed at improving library services through digital innovation.

This system provides a centralized web platform where students can:
- Search for books by title, author, and category  
- View detailed book information  
- Save books to their wishlist  
- Add and read book-specific comments  
- Retrieve availability from a preloaded book dataset (CSV)



Objectives

- Replace outdated library systems with a responsive, fast solution  
- Help students track their favorite books via a personalized wishlist  
- Enable peer-to-peer book discussions through a comment section  
- Reduce the need to visit the library physically for book availability
